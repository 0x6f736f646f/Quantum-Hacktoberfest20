### **Quantum Computing**

How is it different?

Quantum computing is different from regular computers on a fundamental level. 
Instead of using electronic bits as 1's and 0's like we are used to, it uses qubits.

To explain this, I took a segment from https://www.wired.co.uk/article/quantum-computing-explained

Instead of bits, quantum computers use qubits. 
Rather than just being on or off, qubits can also be in what’s called ‘superposition’ – where they’re both on and off at the same time, or somewhere on a spectrum between the two.
Take a coin. 
If you flip it, it can either be heads or tails. But if you spin it – it’s got a chance of landing on heads, and a chance of landing on tails. 
Until you measure it, by stopping the coin, it can be either. 
Superposition is like a spinning coin, and it’s one of the things that makes quantum computers so powerful. A qubit allows for uncertainty.
If you ask a normal computer to figure its way out of a maze, it will try every single branch in turn, ruling them all out individually until it finds the right one. 
A quantum computer can go down every path of the maze at once. It can hold uncertainty in its head.
It’s a bit like keeping a finger in the pages of a choose your own adventure book. 
If your character dies, you can immediately choose a different path, instead of having to return to the start of the book.

Why does this matter? 
It means that quantum computers can view multiple options and outcomes at the same time.

How can we do anything with this information though?
There is another special trait called entanglement. 
In this, 2 particles and "entangled", or connected. They will always have the same outcome.
That means we can have a computer reliably go through every outcome and figure out the best solution.

Why don't we have these everywhere? 
Well, the biggest issue is that they can't be interfered with.
Almost everything will mess up the qubit's result, including temperature.
Quantum computers must be kept at or as close to absolute 0 as possible.

### **Summary**
Quantum computers use qubits instead of bits, which can look through many options and connect to other qubits.
This makes them must quicker than current computers, but they must be isolated and very very cold.
